We have added some text about the difference between trust
establishment in web of trust and hierarchical trust models and how
the difference is relevant.  Web of trust is also traditionally used
with PGP/GPG signatures while hierarchical trust is tradionally used
with SSL/TLS signatures, but this need not be the case. We also now
discuss the possibility of using a web of trust with TLS signatures
via extensions to the Convergence plugin.

This is actually a quote from Let's Encrypt, which we noted in the
text.  We stated it without quotation marks for the rhetorical impact
from saying something and then only afterwards telling the reader that
it was not new with us and indeed is a quote.  We have added more
details about the relative difficulty of setting up an onion service
vs. getting a traditional X.509 certificate.

We already had described the functionality limits of the Tor Browser,
but we have also added more text describing how our approach is
compatible with other, less secure, browsers via tor2web. We note that
usability should not suffer and explain how security does.

We have added some text to explain any terms associated with Tor
(including 'Tor' itself).  All remaining unglossed terms and acronyms
are generic and basic Internet and Web security terms.

We have added a citation. We originally added more, but because 
of the hard 4-page length limit we have ultimately included only one.

We're not sure we understand what is being asked here, but we will
assume it is a request for evidence that it is feasible and relatively
easy to create an onionsite associated with a clearnet website and
include a cryptographically authenticated binding of the two
together. We described in the text setting up an onionsite associated
with a clearnet website and a GPG signature on both sites associating
the two, and we provided a functioning example thereof. This
association is easily confirmed by anyone using GPG.  We have done
that too. We could display the GPG confirmation message, but since we
are at the maximum permitted for length this would be at the expense
of other content. We hope this is responsive to the question.

Thank you. And yes the basic manual mechanism is quite clunky. We have
added a bit about the potential to improve usability with the Firefox
plugin Convergence and a suggestion to explore incorporating PGP
signatures into it and/or to incorporate the more web-of-trust-like
authorization of TLS signatures that could be possible using
Convergence. We also mention Ahmia's expressed intention to
include automatic checks of the signatures and linking with search
results for onionsites and note that a simple plugin could leverage
that.

We believe this is similar to the question asked in Review 2 above.
Our response is the same. We provided not just a simulation but an
example of something running "in the wild". It is so simple, that this
is trivial to do, which is indeed one of the main points.

We have been talking to the developer of Ahmia, the onionspace
search engine, and he has proposed adding exactly this to Ahmia.
We now mention this in the text.
(He plans to add these to the JSON descriptions suggested for each
onionsite, although there was not space to describe that in the paper
due to the 4 page hard limit.)

The convenience difference between using Tor Browser and using other
browsers via Tor2Web is small. It could be made nonexistent simply by
making the posted link to the authenticated version of the site
reflect the Tor2Web.onion address in addition to or instead of the
plain .onion address. The security tradeoffs of opening up to all the
CA issues, plus SSLStrip, cipher degradation attacks, etc. are
significant enough, however, that it is hard to recommend this.  We
have added a bit more text about the issue.
